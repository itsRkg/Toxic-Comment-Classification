# Toxic-Comment-Classification
"Toxic Comment Classification" is a project aimed at developing a machine learning model to automatically identify and classify toxic comments in text data. Toxic comments are those that contain offensive, disrespectful, or harmful language, and can often lead to online harassment, cyberbullying, or the spread of hate speech.
