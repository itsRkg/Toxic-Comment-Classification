# Toxic-Comment-Classification
"Toxic Comment Classification" is a project designed to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically identifying and categorizing toxic comments in textual data. These comments typically contain offensive, disrespectful, or harmful language, contributing to online harassment, cyberbullying, or the dissemination of hate speech. The significance of this project lies in its applicability to real-world scenarios across diverse domains. For instance, social media platforms can employ this technology to enhance content moderation efforts, fostering a safer online environment. Similarly, online communities, forums, news websites, and blogs can utilize toxic comment classification to maintain constructive discourse and curb the spread of negativity or harassment within their respective spaces. Moreover, companies can streamline customer support processes by automatically filtering out toxic comments from various online channels, ensuring prompt attention to genuine customer concerns. Educational platforms and online gaming communities can also benefit from this technology to create more supportive and inclusive environments for their users. Ultimately, by effectively identifying and mitigating toxic comments, this project contributes to promoting healthier online interactions and fostering positive digital communities.


This DL_model.ipynb is the implementation of a toxic comment classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. It begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from a CSV file. The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as cleaning and tokenization using techniques like regular expressions and NLTK. Then, the text data is vectorized using TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer. The dataset is prepared as a TensorFlow dataset, shuffled, and split into training, validation, and test sets.

The model architecture is defined using a Sequential model in Keras, consisting of an Embedding layer for word embeddings, a Bidirectional LSTM layer for sequence processing, and several dense layers for feature extraction and classification. The model is compiled using the BinaryCrossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer. Training history is visualized using Matplotlib.

After training, the model is saved to disk for future use. Testing is performed on both individual samples and batches of data from the test set. Model evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are calculated using TensorFlow's metrics module.
